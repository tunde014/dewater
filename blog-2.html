                <h3>WHAT IS DEWATERING?</h3>
                <p>Dewatering is the process of controlling the flow of underground water that can hinder construction. Also known as Construction Dewatering or Ground water control, it is not limited to the underground flow but in most cases can include the continuous evacuation of surface water within a construction area.</p>
                
                <p>This continuous process is to ensure that the construction site remains dry. When dewatering stops, the flow of the underground water resumes and if the structure is not watertight, can still cause damage, hence the need to ensure the below grade works are fully cured before the dewatering stops.</p>
                
                <p>In construction projects, water is removed to keep work on schedule and to provide safe work environment. Normally, builders tend to use water pumps to dewater these areas but fail to pay attention to side seepages which can cause erosion and other problems. It is important to follow best management practices for dewatering.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-5">WHY DO WE NEED DEWATERING?</h3>
                <p>Many excavations for below grade construction, especially in waterlogged areas, usually encounters groundwater, especially around riverine or coastal areas. This wet land cannot work for most contractors as they would prefer a 'dry' job to a 'wet' one.</p>
                
                <p>If the situation is not well managed, the groundwater can cause major problems during excavation and also during below grade construction. The range of problems can be from continuous flow of water to nuisance seepage from the ground and sides of the excavation.</p>
                
                <p>Construction can be hindered by this because of these problems. Heavy duty machinery can get stuck and more importantly because of the continuous flow of water, materials set in place set very slowly, become compromised and in some cases are totally washed away. In some cases, we have seen construction collapse due to any or a combination of these problems. All these add to the cost and time of any construction.</p>
                
                <p>In Lagos being a coastal state, dewatering is necessary in construction where below grade or major excavation works is needed for a construction project because most areas are below sea level and therefore have high table water level.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-5">WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF DEWATERING?</h3>
                <p>There are quite a few types of Dewatering Processes but the three mostly used in Nigeria are:</p>
                
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li class="mb-3"><strong>1. Sump/Surface Pumping</strong></li>
                  <li class="mb-3"><strong>2. Deep Well</strong></li>
                  <li class="mb-3"><strong>3. WellPoint</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Most constructions in Nigeria usually start during the dry season to take advantage of the drop in the water table, but due to the size and depth of the new builds, this can no longer work.</p>
                
                <p>A lot of companies are using the Shallow well method, but this is can prove to be ineffective in most cases. The best for sandy areas and for excavation up to 18 meters is wellpoint dewatering. Since wellpoint is used to drop the water table around the perimeter of the construction site without dragging the soil, the land is dried, and the soil firmed up.</p>
                
                <p>This does not negate the need for shoring up the surround area with Steel sheet piles to prevent sand slides or collapse of trenches during excavation.</p>
                
                <p>Construction of below grade does not need to be problematic if proper planning and adequate measures are put in place before and during construction.</p>
                
                <p>Adequate planning for the control of groundwater is important and is a necessary part of a well-planned basement construction project. In many countries in the world, when building large buildings or building in high density areas, the Planning Authorities, Party Wall Surveyors and other regulatory bodies would want to see evidence that groundwater will be suitably managed during excavation.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-5">SOME GROUNDWATER PROBLEMS WHEN CONSTRUCTING BELOW GRADE</h3>
                <p>If an excavation is made without suitable groundwater control various problems can result:</p>
                
                <ul>
                  <li>The excavation may flood as a result of groundwater inflows from water-bearing layers of soil or rocks.</li>
                  <li>High pore water pressures in batter slopes at the sides of the excavation may lead to instability or seepage erosion of batter slopes.</li>
                  <li>Groundwater uplift pressures beneath the floor of an excavation can give the risk of a base heave or piping failure in the base of the excavation.</li>
                  <li>Groundwater pressures can cause excessive hydrostatic loads on excavation retaining structures such as concrete pile walls.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="mt-5">THE NEED FOR SOIL TESTING</h3>
                <p>A soil test needs to be done to determine the water table level and soil stratification before a dewatering plan can be put in place. Once this has been done, an analysis of the soil type would help to determine the best suited method of dewatering to employ if need be. Multiple point soil test would help to enhance the best method to adopt.</p>
                
                <p>In the case of Victoria Island, Ikoyi and parts of Lekki we have found that the soil layer is mostly sandy and the best plan to adopt is the Wellpoint for excavations of up to 10 meters. However, if the perimeter of the land is much bigger than the print of the build itself, a multi-layered dewatering plan can be adopted.</p>
                
                <p>The Wellpoint dewatering system helps to dry the area needed fast and has minimum soil extraction, helping in soil compaction.</p>
                
                <p>The process involves planting filters around the excavation leaving an ingress for excavation equipment to move in and out. The planting and drainage of the area is usually started a few weeks before for adequate drainage of the soil before commencing excavation.</p>
                
                <p>The dewatering machine runs nonstop for 24 hours daily and 7 days a week as a shutdown can cause harm as there would be return of water immediately which can damage or delay construction.</p>
                
                <p>During the rainy season or in the case of flooding of a surface, a surface water pumping machine is always advised to be on standby to be employed for immediate evacuation of any surface water.</p>
